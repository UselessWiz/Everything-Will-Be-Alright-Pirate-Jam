Ignore my bad code please, it runs and thats all that matters. WEB PORT contains the final, up to date version of the game. ACTUAL KNI TEST was an initial testing ground for the web. JamGame is the OpenGL version of the game I used for most of development. This version is not up to date at the moment, odds are I'm not updating it.
