We might think we're complex, but we're only made up of two parts.
The first is our soul, the core of our being. (person) - DONE.

The other is our shadow, a place the light never touches.
Almost like a negative photo. (Person with shadow) - DONE.

Shadows are fuelled by fear. (monster under bed) - DONE.

As people connect with others, their souls become closer together.
So do their shadows. (People with some sort of lines to indicate a connection?)

Eventually, once people connect closely enough with others...
... their souls and shadows combine. (holding hands) - DONE.

On its own, a person's shadow feeds back their own negativity. 
When shadows combine, the fears the combined souls share are amplified beyond the negativity of any one person (shadows holding hands) - DONE. 

If the wrong people connect, and the wrong fears merge together... - DONE.

FEAR WILL CONSUME (fade to black, boss arena appears) - DONE.
