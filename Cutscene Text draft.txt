We might think we're complex, but we're only made up of two parts.
The first is our soul, the core of our being. (person)

The other is our shadow, a place the light never touches.
Almost like a negative photo. (Person with shadow)

Shadows are fuelled by fear. (monster under bed)

As people connect with others, their souls become closer together.
So do their shadows. (People with some sort of lines to indicate a connection?)

Eventually, once people connect closely enough with others...
... their souls and shadows combine. (holding hands) - DONE

On its own, a person's shadow feeds back their own negativity.  // THIS LINE IS STILL NOT RIGHT. EVERYTHING ELSE FITS WELL. VIEW MESSAGES WITH REL FOR MORE.
When shadows combine, the fears the combined souls share are amplified beyond the negativity of any one person (shadows holding hands) - DONE. // WITH THIS CHANGE THE ABOVE WORKS BUT THE LINE IS SO LONG I DON'T LIKE IT

If the wrong people connect, and the wrong fears merge together... - DONE but do more - More lines to indicate some sort of connection?

FEAR WILL CONSUME (fade to black, boss arena appears) - HAVE BACKGROUND, JUST WRITE TEXT.
