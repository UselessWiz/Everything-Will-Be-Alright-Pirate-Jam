We might think we’re complex, but we’re only made up of two parts.
The first is our soul, the core of our being. (person in room)

The other is our shadow, a place the light never touches.
Almost like a negative photo. (Person in park with shadow)

Shadows are fuelled by fear. (protagonist in room with monster under bed)

As people connect with others, their souls become closer together.
So do their shadows. (protag and gf on bench)

Eventually, once people connect closely enough with others…
… their souls and shadows combine. (holding hands)

On its own, a person’s shadow feeds back their own negativity.  // THIS LINE IS STILL NOT RIGHT. EVERYTHING ELSE FITS WELL. VIEW MESSAGES WITH REL FOR MORE.
When shadows combine, the fears the combined souls share are amplified beyond the negativity of any one person (shadows holding hands). // WITH THIS CHANGE THE ABOVE WORKS BUT THE LINE IS SO LONG I DON'T LIKE IT

If the wrong people connect, and the wrong fears merge together… (sitting on bed in room)

FEAR WILL CONSUME (fade to black, boss arena appears).
